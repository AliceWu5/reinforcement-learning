# reinforcement-learning

To finish my thesis, "Methods and implementations for coordinated multi-agent learning", which involves a research on RL from single agent to multi-agent, as well as the state-of-the-art in collaborative and coordinated multi-agent learning algorithms and implementations. And here, the implementations in MATLAB for some RL methods are done. The thesis paper shall be uploaded in a not long future, where contains the references.

## Single Agent Reinforcement Learning

* Dynamic Programming
* Monte Carlo Methods
* Temporal-Difference Learning
* Linear Function Approximation
* Deep-Q Network
* Policy Gradient with Linear Function Approximation

## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

* Centralized Q-Learning
* Hysteretic Q-Learning
* Multi-Agent Actor-Critic
